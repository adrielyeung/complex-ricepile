# complex-ricepile
This project simulates the Oslo model in complexity science, which shows that some responses of a system to a slowly-driven perturbation are irrespective of its scale. The perturbation was simulated by a continuous addition of "rice grains" to a system of certain length (number of sites), and the response was measured by toppling of the grains to the neighbouring site.
